I have wirtten a <em>quick and dirty</em> script to knock this step out without halting my momentum; my ADD doesn&apos;t need competition from my workflow.</p>
<!--short-->
<aside>

<strong>Update:</strong> My workflow is now being helped along by github&apos;s
<a href="https://github.com/github/hub">hub</a> tool, which is excellent.<br>
Go <del>git</del> get it right now, you won&apos;t be sorry.

<h3 id="the-quick-">The Quick:</h3>
<p>The script does the following given a project name, and optional description string:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creates project subdirctory, named after project name</li>
<li>CDs into that directory and initzilizes a new git repo</li>
<li>Touches an empty README.md file and adds it to the git index.</li>
<li>Commits the changes with the comment &apos;init&apos;</li>
<li><p>Makes an api call to github to new up a repo named after the project</p>
<ul>
<li>This ends up asking for my git password, which I like just fine.</li>
<li>This also redirects the response ouput to /dev/null which is kinda lame.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adds the remote, as origin</li>
<li>Pushes to origin/master</li>
</ol>
<p>This happens in a few seconds and without any need to leave the terminal.</p>
<h3 id="the-dirty-">The Dirty:</h3>
<p>The script is not at all robust, and requires many things to not go wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any error with any step will be unhandled, and probably break all subsequent steps, and surely leave things in an unknown state.</li>
<li>This does not handle the problem of preexisting repos in your current directory, or on github with the same name.</li>
<li>This uses the same name for the directory and reposistory and hasn&apos;t been tested with anything outside of simple camelCase or dash-seperated project names</li>
<li>The script can not be reran to correct an error that occured</li>
</ul>
<p>But really the solution to any of these problems is just to <code>cd..</code> &amp; <code>rm -rf</code> the folder the script created. Because I run this script before writing any code, npm&apos;ing any packages, etc. I can afford a messy script that doesn&apos;t disturb the muses.</p>
<h3 id="the-code-">The Code:</h3>
<p>The following sits in my funcs file and can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/refactorized/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> repo.</p>
<pre><code>  gh-summon () { #todo: add conditionals for breaking if error.
      echo Summoning Octocat to create $1 repository...
      mkdir $1
      cd $1
      git init
      #todo: construct readme from name and desc, copy some default .gitignore
      touch README.md
      git add README.md
      git commit -am&quot;init&quot;
      #todo: something more useful with output
      curl -u $(cfg github.username) https://api.github.com/user/repos -d &quot;{\&quot;name\&quot;:\&quot;${1}\&quot;,\&quot;description\&quot;:\&quot;$2\&quot;}&quot; &gt; /dev/null
      git remote add origin git@github.com:$(cfg github.username)/$1.git
      git push origin master
  }
</code></pre><p>and it reads pretty much like the bulletted list above, rendered in simple and likely inelegant bash script. It is added in my .bash_profile chain and invoking it looks like this:</p>
<p><code>gh-summon empty-repo &quot;now with 9000% more working code&quot;</code></p>
<p>which looks like this in my terminal:</p>
<p><img src="https://refactorized.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/imgs/summon-octocat-terminal.png" alt="Terminal Screenshot"></p>
<p>and just like that, I have a repo on github:</p>
<p><img src="https://refactorized.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/imgs/summon-octocat-new-repo.png" alt="GitHub Screenshot"></p>
<p>I hope you find the script useful; I know I do, even if it is a little sloppy. Feel free to copy, improve and share, and if you make anything cool with it let me know.</p>
